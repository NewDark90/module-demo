### No Modules, Inline

Timeline: ~1995

- Lack of Code Reusability: If we need to add another page and need some of the functions from this page, we will have to copy and paste the code
- Lack of Dependency Resolution: You are responsible for having your functions defined before they are used.
- Pollution of global namespace: All the functions and variables will reside on global scope.
